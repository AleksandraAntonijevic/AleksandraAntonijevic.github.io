    <h1>Aleksandra Antonijević</h1>
    <p>I was born on July 11th 2000, in Belgrade, where I finished an elementary school as the best student in generation. 
        Upon graduating from elementary school, I enrolled in Sixth Belgrade Grammar school in the year 2015. </p>
    <p>Throughout my years in both elementary and high school, I was interested in many different field, so I started actively participating in numerous competitions across various subjects. These competitions allowed me to showcase my skills and knowledge, and I was fortunate enough to secure victories in many of them. 
        Notably, I achieved a significant milestone by winning the national history competition two years in a row.</p>

    <p>Later, in high school, I received the 'Vuk Karadzic' award, which encouraged me to continue pursuing my dreams. 
        After high school, I decided to study <strong><text class="letter"><a href="http://www.ekof.bg.ac.rs/studije/osnovne/studijski-programi/poslovna-analiza-i-konsalting/"> Business analysis and consulting</a></text></strong> at 
        <strong><text class="letter"><a href="http://www.ekof.bg.ac.rs/"> Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Belgrade</a></strong></text>, and I successfully earned my Bachelor's degree. While studying, 
        I wanted to give back to my community, so I volunteered in different student organizations.
    </br>As a mentor and coordinator within Student Mentorship Program of Faculty of Economics and Business, I was happy to guide freshmen during first academic year and help them to achieve the best possible results. Also, I was an active member of the Investment Club at mentioned Faculty. 
    These experiences not only allowed me to help others but also taught me valuable lessons about leadership, teamwork, and collaboration, which helped me grow as a person.</p>
