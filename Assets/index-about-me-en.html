            <p>I was born on July 11th 2000, in Belgrade, where I finished an elementary school as the best student in generation. 
                Upon graduating from elementary school, I enrolled in Sixth Belgrade Grammar School in the year 2015. </p><br/>
            <p>Throughout my years in both elementary and high school, I was interested in many different field, so I started actively participating in numerous competitions across various subjects. These competitions allowed me to showcase my skills and knowledge, and I was fortunate enough to secure victories in many of them. 
            Notably, I achieved a significant milestone by winning the national history competition two years in a row.</p><br/>
            <p>Later, in high school, I received the 'Vuk Karadžić' award, which encouraged me to continue pursuing my dreams. 
            After high school, I decided to study <a href="http://www.ekof.bg.ac.rs/studije/osnovne/studijski-programi/poslovna-analiza-i-konsalting/"> Business analysis and consulting</a> at 
            <a href="http://www.ekof.bg.ac.rs/"> Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Belgrade</a>, and I successfully earned my Bachelor's degree. While studying, 
            I wanted to give back to my community, so I volunteered in different student organizations.<br/>
            </br>As a mentor and coordinator within <a href="http://www.ekof.bg.ac.rs/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Prezentacija-za-sajt-fb-ispravljena.pdf">Student Mentorship Program</a> of Faculty of Economics and Business, I was happy to guide freshmen during first academic year and help them to achieve the best possible results. 
            Also, I was an active member of the <a href="https://rs.linkedin.com/company/ekof-investicioni-klub">Investment Club</a></Investment> at mentioned faculty. 
            These experiences not only allowed me to help others but also taught me valuable lessons about leadership, teamwork, and collaboration, which helped me grow as a person.</p><br/>
            <p>I am employed as a data analyst in a respected market research company, where I apply my analytical skills 
            to derive meaningful insights from complex data sets. Simultaneously, 
            I hold the position of a graduate student instructor, teaching a course on business analytics at the Faculty of Economics and Business.</p>
            <P>I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Business Informatics, further deepening my understanding of data analysis and information technology.</P>
